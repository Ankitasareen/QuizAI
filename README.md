 # Inspiration üí°
Are you bored with giving quizzes and exams online? Do not worry, we got you covered. We have a virtual Quiz built on AI that will give you an amazing experience along with knowledge.

Because of pandemic, education has shifted from classrooms to mobiles and computers ie to the virtual mode. However, sitting for long hours in front of screens can be boring and irritating.
These facts inspired me to build an AI-powered Quiz web app that uses computer vision to track our choice and gives scores according to it. It will somehow make this process more interesting and will make students appear these tests with much interest and enthusiasm. Also, sometimes due to running out of time, we aren't able to click on the submit button, and our scores come out to be zero. Our web app will auto-submit the answers once all the answers are marked by the fingertip cursor, making the whole quizzing process hassle-free.

# What it does üíª
An AI powdered quiz web app which is built on computer vision, detects our hand movement and fingertip as a cursor and we can select the answers by our fingertip. It has a quiz window, where the questions and options are displayed and we have to choose the answer by our fingertip. Also, there's a progress bar that shows how many questions have been answered. At last, after all the questions have been answered, it auto submits and gives our score out of 100%. All this makes the process of giving tests and quizzes more interesting and hassle-free.

# Challenges we ran into üß†
- This was a far bigger project than I thought it would be and with all the time constraints and since I was working alone, I had to do everything by myself.
-Had some initial trouble with our Open-CV model as it was not showing proper results, then trained it for better. Answers were not detected properly but somehow, I again wrote the algorithm and corrected it. 
- Faced an initial setback with the front end but then made the whole UI in streamlit.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of #üèÖ
- This application is built in a single day by me! It has a simple yet great user interface.
 - I could successfully train the AI model and deploy it to detect the answers being marked by our fingers on the quiz window.
- I could successfully show the progress metrics - designed the **progress bar** and displayed the **final score**.
- I could also enable the **auto-submit** feature for it making the whole quizzing process hassle-free for the teachers as well as for students.
- My **biggest achievement** would be that I got a little confidence as I can build what I imagine!!! 24 hours ago this was just an Idea, now it is a working application.

# What we learned #üèÖ
I learned a ton of new stuff. Whenever I make a new project it always teaches me something completely new which I was not aware of before. It taught me to work more efficiently and handle different parts of the project, keeping the deadline in mind and forming a proper pathway to finish the project on time. Working with various ML models and deploying them properly. Integrating various parts of the project which none of us were very experienced with.

# What's next for QuizAI #üèÖ
- Implementing other forms of quizzes 
- Deploying the model with less weight so that it is more smooth and well functioning
- Adding more features to it and create a website out of it.
